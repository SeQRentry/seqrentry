   <h1>What is SeQRentry?</h1>

   <p><cite>SeQRentry</cite> is a highly secure method to sign in to
web sites online by using nothing except your phone and a simple, easy
to remember PIN code.</p>

   <p>Any web site that uses a username and password can be
<cite>SeQRentry</cite>-enabled within minutes, and the phone app will soon be available
for all major mobile operating systems &#x2014; all totally free of charge.</p>

   <p>So try it now, and help making the Internet a more secure place for all of us,
no matter if you are an end user, web site master or developer!</p>

  </section>

  <section id="why">
   <h1>Why <cite>SeQRentry</cite>?</h1>

   <p>Why should you care? After all, we log in to web sites all the
time, and it works just fine, right? No, actually it <em>does not</em>
work <q>just fine</q>. Something is rotten in the state of the
Internet. Very rotten.</p>

   <h2>Face reality</h2>

   <p>It used to be simple. You had one password for email and
possibly a second one for MSN or ICQ (remember those?). Perhaps you
used the same password for both services. Big deal.</p>

   <p>But now? Facebook, Twitter, Google/Gmail, Live/Hotmail, iCloud,
iTunes, Amazon, Netflix, Yahoo, eBay, LinkedIn, various forums, web
shops and dozens if not hundreds of other sites on the net want you to
identify yourself using a name and a password.</p>

   <p><em>Of course</em> you use the same password for most of
them. All of us do. How the hell would we rememeber how to log in
if not?</p>

   <p>Web sites and password databases can be hacked into, many
passwords can be brute-forced and the most can simply be <a
href="http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time">guessed</a>
with no effort at all.</p>

  <h2>Worst case scenario</h2>

  <p>Most web sites can reset your password using a link sent to your
email address. If a criminal gains access to your primary or even your
secondary email account&#x2014;you didn't use that one as the recovery
address for your primary email account, did you?&#x2014;he or she
<em>can do almost anything</em>: post obscene pictures to Facebook in
your name, access your private photo collection, spend your money on
Amazon or remote-wipe your iPhone or even computer. Yes, really.</p>

  <h2>A realistic remedy</h2>

  <p>Security experts tell you to use long, hard-to-remember passwords
and make up a new, unique password for each new service you sign up
for. Well, good for them!  That's not going to fly.</p>

  <p>Some organizations, such as banks, might use custom code boxes,
client-side SSL certificates, smart cards or fingerprint sensors. It's
not like you always have all that gear with you in your pockets,
is it?</p>

  <p>So what <em>do</em> you always have with you in you pockets?
Yeah, that's right. <em>Your phone.</em></p>

  <p><cite>SeQRentry</cite> combines a physical thing <em>you
have</em>&#x2014;your phone&#x2014;with a PIN-code <em>you know</em>
and lets you log in to web sites using those two items
combined. That's called <q>Two-factor authentication</q>, and that's
probably what your bank uses to protect your savings
account. <cite>SeQRentry</cite> makes this strong authentication
method available <em>everywhere</em>.</p>

  <h2>Benefits for end-users</h2>

  <p>You can stop worry about somebody breaking in to your user
accounts, and you can stop feeling bad for reusing such a pathetic
password on more sites that you can remember. You don't have to
remember the passwords for each site anymore. In fact, <em>nobody</em>
will know the actual password&#x2014;not you, not we, not the site
owner (assuming they hash their users' passwords, and most of them
thankfully do) and definately no scumbag criminal.</p>

  <p>You don't even have to remember your <em>login name</em> anymore;
just scan a QR code with your phone, enter your 4 or 6 digit PIN and
<cite>SeQRentry</cite> with automatically fill in the login name and
password for you!</p>

  <h2>Benefits for web site owners</h2>

  <p>If your users' passwords are secure, unique and unguessable,
nobody is going to mess with your users' accounts. Isn't that
fantastic?</p>

  <p><cite>SeQRentry</cite> works with your existing username/password
system. All you need to do is to include a JavaScript file and add a
few HTML attributes, and you're done. It's that easy.</p>

  <p>For high-volume sites, you probably want to host your own
<cite>SeQRentry</cite> proxy service though. It's a good thing that
everything is open source software, then, isn't it?</p>

  <h2>Benefits for keyring app developers</h2>

  <p>Developers of mobile keyring apps can even
<cite>SeQRentry</cite>-enable their own apps according to the
specifications and let their users send the passwords directly to the
web sites using the <cite>SeQRentry</cite> protocol.</p>

  <h2>Benefits for criminals</h2>

  <p>None!</p>
